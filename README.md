## ⚡ get started in literally 30 seconds

```bash
# one command. that's it. we're not kidding
npx @onchainagents/setup

# or if you're old school
npm install @onchainagents/core
```

```typescript
import { OnChainAgents } from '@onchainagents/core';

// boom. you now have institutional-grade crypto intel
const oca = new OnChainAgents({ 
  hiveApiKey: 'your-api-key' 
});

// is this token gonna rug you? let's find out
const analysis = await oca.analyze('ethereum', '0x...');
console.log(analysis); // probably saved you from a rugpull
```

## 🔥 why this exists

look, we're tired of:
- paying $500/month for "pro" crypto tools that barely work
- getting rugged because we didn't have access to proper analysis
- watching whales make millions while we're stuck with basic charts
- institutional traders having all the alpha while retail gets rekt

**so we built this. completely free. open source. no bs.**

## 🧠 meet your new crypto brain trust

### 🛡️ the security squad
**rug detector** → scans contracts like a paranoid genius  
- catches honeypots before you ape in
- finds hidden mint functions
- spots sketchy owner privileges
- basically your bodyguard against scams

**risk analyzer** → thinks about risk so you don't have to  
- multi-factor risk scoring that actually makes sense
- historical rugpull pattern matching
- vulnerability detection that works

### 📈 the money makers
**alpha hunter** → finds gems before they moon  
- tracks unusual volume spikes
- monitors smart money movements
- social sentiment correlation
- basically prints money (not financial advice)

**whale tracker** → stalks the big boys  
- real-time whale movement alerts
- wallet clustering analysis
- copy trading opportunities
- know what they know

**sentiment analyzer** → reads the room across all of crypto twitter  
- aggregates social signals
- filters out the noise
- trend prediction that actually works

### 🔬 the researchers
**token researcher** → deep dives so you don't have to  
- tokenomics analysis that makes sense
- team background checks
- utility assessment
- basically a private investigator for tokens

**defi analyzer** → navigates the yield farming jungle  
- finds the best yields
- calculates real APY (not the fake marketing ones)
- impermanent loss warnings
- protocol safety scores

**portfolio tracker** → your personal accountant  
- multi-chain tracking (because who uses just one chain?)
- P&L that includes gas fees (revolutionary, we know)
- tax reporting that doesn't suck

### 🌐 the specialists
**cross-chain navigator** → bridge expert extraordinaire  
- finds cheapest routes
- calculates real costs (including slippage)
- bridge safety ratings
- saves you from bridge hacks

**market structure analyst** → sees the matrix  
- order book depth analysis
- liquidity distribution mapping
- MEV detection
- finds the best entry/exit points

## 💪 the commands (dead simple)

```bash
# check if token is safu
/oca:security <token_address>

# deep dive on any token
/oca:research <token_symbol>

# general analysis (throws everything at it)
/oca:analyze <token>

# find the next 100x (not financial advice)
/oca:hunt [--risk low]

# stalk the whales
/oca:track <wallet_address>

# read the room
/oca:sentiment <token>
```

## 🚀 real examples that'll blow your mind

### stop getting rugged
```typescript
const safety = await oca.security.rugDetector.analyze('0x...');
// Result: { score: 23, verdict: 'DANGER', risks: ['HONEYPOT_DETECTED', 'LIQUIDITY_UNLOCKED'] }
// just saved your ass
```

### find gems before everyone else
```typescript
const opportunities = await oca.market.alphaHunter.scan({
  minLiquidity: 100000,
  maxMarketCap: 10000000,
  socialGrowth: 'increasing'
});
// Result: 5 tokens about to explode (maybe)
```

### copy trade like a whale
```typescript
const whaleActivity = await oca.market.whaleTracker.monitor({
  minTransaction: 1000000,
  networks: ['ethereum', 'bsc'],
  timeframe: '1h'
});
// Result: whale just bought $2M of some random token
// you know what to do
```

## 🏗️ how it actually works

```
you → command → agents → hive intelligence (250TB of data) → profit
```

that's it. no complicated setup. no docker containers. no kubernetes. just works.

## 📊 some numbers that matter

- ⚡ **<500ms** average response (faster than your ex's "we need to talk" text)
- 🎯 **95%+ accuracy** on rugpull detection (the 5% keeps you humble)
- 🔄 **99.9% uptime** (we sleep so the agents don't have to)
- 📈 **60+ blockchains** supported (even the weird ones)
- 🚀 **1000+ requests/min** capacity (go crazy)

## 🛡️ security (because we're not hypocrites)

- your API keys are encrypted (obviously)
- rate limiting so you don't accidentally DDoS yourself
- input sanitization (no little bobby tables here)
- audit logs for everything
- regular security updates (we're paranoid too)

## 🤝 wanna contribute?

hell yeah! we need:
- more agents (got ideas? build them!)
- bug hunters (break our stuff, we'll fix it)
- documentation writers (explain things better than us)
- memers (seriously, we need better memes)

```bash
# fork it
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/onchainagents.fun

# make it better
npm install
npm test

# ship it
git push && open PR
```
