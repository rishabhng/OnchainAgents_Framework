## 🎉 v1.0 - Full SuperClaude Parity Achieved!

**OnChainAgents now has complete feature parity with Anthropic's SuperClaude Framework**, adapted specifically for crypto/blockchain operations. 20 core components, 11 specialized personas, enterprise-grade orchestration.

### What's New in v1.0:
- ✅ **Wave Orchestration**: Multi-stage execution with compound intelligence
- ✅ **11 Crypto Personas**: WhaleHunter, DeFiArchitect, SecurityAuditor, and more
- ✅ **Intelligent Routing**: Master routing table with confidence scoring
- ✅ **Circuit Breakers**: 3-state resilience with automatic recovery
- ✅ **Evidence Generation**: On-chain proofs with merkle tree aggregation
- ✅ **Token Optimization**: 30-50% reduction with crypto symbols
- ✅ **Emergency Protocols**: 10 market volatility scenarios
- ✅ **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time metrics with crypto-specific tracking

## 🏗️ Architecture (SuperClaude-Powered)

OnChainAgents implements the complete SuperClaude Framework architecture:

```
Claude Desktop → OnChainAgents MCP Server → Orchestrator → Personas → Hive Intelligence
                                                ↓
                                         Wave Engine → Sub-Agents
                                                ↓
                                         Quality Gates → Evidence
```

- **Intelligent Orchestrator**: Detection engine with complexity scoring
- **Resource Zones**: 5-zone management (Green/Yellow/Orange/Red/Critical)
- **Wave Engine**: 4 strategies (Progressive/Systematic/Adaptive/Enterprise)
- **11 Specialized Personas**: Domain experts with auto-activation
- **Multi-Source Coordination**: Hive Intelligence + 9 fallback sources

## ⚡ get started in literally 30 seconds

```bash
# install from npm (once published)
npm install @onchainagents/core

# or clone and build locally
git clone https://github.com/onchainagents/onchainagents.fun
cd onchainagents.fun
npm install && npm run build
```

### Quick Setup

1. **Create a `.env` file:**
```env
# Contact Hive Intelligence for API access: https://t.me/hiveintelligence
HIVE_MCP_URL=https://hiveintelligence.xyz/mcp
HIVE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here  # Optional - get from Hive Intelligence

# Enable fallback mode for testing (uses simulated data)
HIVE_FALLBACK_MODE=true
```

2. **Start analyzing:**
```typescript
import { OnChainAgents } from '@onchainagents/core';

// boom. you now have institutional-grade crypto intel
const oca = new OnChainAgents({
  fallbackMode: true, // Use simulated data for testing
});

// is this token gonna rug you? let's find out
const analysis = await oca.analyze('ethereum', '0x...');
console.log(analysis); // probably saved you from a rugpull
```

## 🤖 Claude Desktop Integration (MCP)

### Automatic Setup
```bash
# Run our setup script
./setup-claude.sh
```

### Manual Setup
Add to your Claude Desktop config (`~/.config/claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "onchainagents": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@onchainagents/core", "oca-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "HIVE_FALLBACK_MODE": "true"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Using in Claude
Once configured, you can use OnChainAgents tools directly in Claude:
- "Use oca_analyze to analyze ethereum 0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48"
- "Use oca_hunt to find alpha opportunities in DeFi"
- "Use oca_security to check if this token is safe: 0x..."
- "Use oca_track to monitor whale wallet 0x..."

## 🔥 why this exists

look, we're tired of:
- paying $500/month for "pro" crypto tools that barely work
- getting rugged because we didn't have access to proper analysis
- watching whales make millions while we're stuck with basic charts
- institutional traders having all the alpha while retail gets rekt

**so we built this. completely free. open source. no bs.**
