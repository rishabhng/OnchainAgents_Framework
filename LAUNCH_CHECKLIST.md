## 🔴 CRITICAL BLOCKERS (Must fix before launch)

### 1. ❌ Hive Intelligence MCP Integration
**Status**: Using simulated data (fallback mode)
**Required Actions**:
- [ ] Contact Hive Intelligence for production API key: https://t.me/hiveintelligence
- [ ] Test real MCP connection with production credentials
- [ ] Verify all MCP tool calls work with real data
- [ ] Remove dependency on fallback/simulated data
- [ ] Validate response formats match expected schemas

**Test Command**: 
```bash
HIVE_FALLBACK_MODE=false npm run test:connection
```

### 2. ❌ NPM Package Publishing
**Status**: Package not published to npm registry
**Required Actions**:
- [ ] Create npm organization @onchainagents
- [ ] Publish @onchainagents/core package
- [ ] Publish @onchainagents/setup package
- [ ] Test installation from npm registry
- [ ] Verify all dependencies are included

**Publishing Commands**:
```bash
npm login
npm publish --access public
```

### 3. ⚠️ Security Hardening
**Status**: Basic security, needs production hardening
**Required Actions**:
- [ ] Add input validation for all user inputs
- [ ] Implement rate limiting (60 requests/minute)
- [ ] Add request signing/authentication
- [ ] Secure API key storage best practices
- [ ] Add SQL injection prevention
- [ ] Implement XSS protection
- [ ] Add CORS configuration
